# Space Invaders - Phase 2: Player Ship

## Overview
In this phase, you'll create the player's spaceship, make it move left and right using arrow keys, and prevent it from going off the screen edges.

## Prerequisites
- Complete Phase 1 (basic game structure running)
- Have `space_invaders.py` open and ready to edit

---

## Step 1: Create Player Variables

Add these lines **after your constants** (after `FPS = 60`) and **before the game loop**:

```python
# Player position (start at bottom center of screen)
player_x = WIDTH // 2 - PLAYER_WIDTH // 2
player_y = HEIGHT - PLAYER_HEIGHT - 20

# Player velocity (how fast it's currently moving)
player_velocity = 0
```

**What this does:**
- `player_x`: Horizontal position (starts in center: WIDTH // 2)
- `player_y`: Vertical position (near bottom: HEIGHT - PLAYER_HEIGHT - 20)
- `player_velocity`: Current speed (-PLAYER_SPEED, 0, or +PLAYER_SPEED)
- The `// 2` centers the player by dividing screen width in half

**Visual explanation:**
```
Screen coordinates:
(0,0) ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ (800,0)
  ‚îÇ                            ‚îÇ
  ‚îÇ         Game Area          ‚îÇ
  ‚îÇ                            ‚îÇ
  ‚îÇ          [SHIP]  ‚Üê player here (centered, near bottom)
(0,600) ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ(800,600)
```

---

## Step 2: Handle Keyboard Input

**Replace** the event handling section in your game loop. Change this:

```python
    # Handle events
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False
```

**To this:**

```python
    # Handle events
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

        # Key pressed down
        if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                player_velocity = -PLAYER_SPEED
            if event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                player_velocity = PLAYER_SPEED

        # Key released
        if event.type == pygame.KEYUP:
            if event.key == pygame.K_LEFT and player_velocity < 0:
                player_velocity = 0
            if event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT and player_velocity > 0:
                player_velocity = 0
```

**What this does:**
- `KEYDOWN`: When you press a key, start moving
- `KEYUP`: When you release a key, stop moving
- Checks which key was pressed (LEFT or RIGHT arrow)
- Sets velocity to negative (left) or positive (right) or zero (stopped)

**Why KEYDOWN and KEYUP?**
- KEYDOWN makes the ship start moving
- KEYUP makes the ship stop when you release the key
- This gives smooth, responsive controls

---

## Step 3: Update Player Position

Add these lines **after the event loop** and **before `screen.fill(BLACK)`**:

```python
    # Update player position
    player_x += player_velocity

    # Keep player on screen (boundary checking)
    if player_x < 0:
        player_x = 0
    if player_x > WIDTH - PLAYER_WIDTH:
        player_x = WIDTH - PLAYER_WIDTH
```

**What this does:**
- `player_x += player_velocity`: Moves the player based on current velocity
- **Boundary checking**: Prevents player from going off screen edges
  - If `player_x < 0`: Hit left edge, snap back to 0
  - If `player_x > WIDTH - PLAYER_WIDTH`: Hit right edge, snap back

**Why `WIDTH - PLAYER_WIDTH`?**
- The player is 50 pixels wide
- Screen is 800 pixels wide
- If player_x = 800, the ship would be completely off screen
- So maximum x position = 800 - 50 = 750

---

## Step 4: Draw the Player

Add these lines **after `screen.fill(BLACK)`** in the `# TODO: Game logic will go here` section:

```python
    # Draw player ship
    pygame.draw.rect(screen, GREEN, (player_x, player_y, PLAYER_WIDTH, PLAYER_HEIGHT))

    # Optional: Draw a "cockpit" detail on the ship
    pygame.draw.polygon(screen, WHITE, [
        (player_x + PLAYER_WIDTH // 2, player_y),  # Top center point
        (player_x + 10, player_y + PLAYER_HEIGHT), # Bottom left
        (player_x + PLAYER_WIDTH - 10, player_y + PLAYER_HEIGHT) # Bottom right
    ])
```

**What this does:**
- `pygame.draw.rect()`: Draws the main body of the ship (green rectangle)
- Parameters: (screen, color, (x, y, width, height))
- `pygame.draw.polygon()`: Draws a triangle "cockpit" on top (optional but looks cool!)
- The polygon uses three points to create a triangle shape

**Visual result:**
```
    /\      ‚Üê White triangle (cockpit)
   /  \
  [====]    ‚Üê Green rectangle (ship body)
```

## Complete Phase 2 Code

Your game loop section should now look like this:

```python
# Game loop
running = True
while running:
    # Handle events
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

        # Key pressed down
        if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                player_velocity = -PLAYER_SPEED
            if event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                player_velocity = PLAYER_SPEED

        # Key released
        if event.type == pygame.KEYUP:
            if event.key == pygame.K_LEFT and player_velocity < 0:
                player_velocity = 0
            if event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT and player_velocity > 0:
                player_velocity = 0

    # Update player position
    player_x += player_velocity

    # Keep player on screen (boundary checking)
    if player_x < 0:
        player_x = 0
    if player_x > WIDTH - PLAYER_WIDTH:
        player_x = WIDTH - PLAYER_WIDTH

    # Fill screen with black
    screen.fill(BLACK)

    # Draw player ship
    pygame.draw.rect(screen, GREEN, (player_x, player_y, PLAYER_WIDTH, PLAYER_HEIGHT))

    # Optional: Draw a "cockpit" detail on the ship
    pygame.draw.polygon(screen, WHITE, [
        (player_x + PLAYER_WIDTH // 2, player_y),
        (player_x + 10, player_y + PLAYER_HEIGHT),
        (player_x + PLAYER_WIDTH - 10, player_y + PLAYER_HEIGHT)
    ])

    # Update the display
    pygame.display.flip()

    # Control frame rate
    clock.tick(FPS)

# Quit pygame
pygame.quit()
```

## Testing Phase 2

Run the game:
```bash
python space_invaders.py
```

**Expected results:**
1. Green spaceship appears at bottom center of screen
2. Press **LEFT arrow** ‚Üí ship moves left
3. Press **RIGHT arrow** ‚Üí ship moves right
4. Release keys ‚Üí ship stops moving
5. Ship cannot move off the screen edges
6. White triangle "cockpit" on top of the ship (if you added it)

**Troubleshooting:**

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Ship doesn't appear | Check that drawing code is AFTER `screen.fill(BLACK)` |
| Ship won't move | Check you added the player_velocity variable before the loop |
| Ship goes off screen | Check boundary code is BEFORE drawing |
| Ship doesn't stop when key released | Check KEYUP event handling |

## What You Learned

1. **Event-driven input**: Using KEYDOWN and KEYUP events
2. **Velocity-based movement**: Using a velocity variable to control speed
3. **Boundary collision**: Keeping objects on screen with if statements
4. **Drawing shapes**: Using `pygame.draw.rect()` and `pygame.draw.polygon()`
5. **Coordinate math**: Understanding x/y positioning and centering

---

## Experimentation Ideas

Try modifying these values to see what happens:

1. **Change speed**: Modify `PLAYER_SPEED = 5` to 3 (slower) or 10 (faster)
2. **Change color**: Replace `GREEN` with `BLUE` or `RED`
3. **Change size**: Modify `PLAYER_WIDTH` and `PLAYER_HEIGHT`
4. **Add more details**: Draw circles for engines using `pygame.draw.circle()`

Example - add engine flames:
```python
# Draw red circles as engines
pygame.draw.circle(screen, RED, (player_x + 10, player_y + PLAYER_HEIGHT), 5)
pygame.draw.circle(screen, RED, (player_x + PLAYER_WIDTH - 10, player_y + PLAYER_HEIGHT), 5)
```

---

## Next Steps

Once Phase 2 is working perfectly, you're ready for **Phase 3: Shooting Mechanics** where you'll:
- Create bullets when spacebar is pressed
- Make bullets move up the screen
- Handle multiple bullets at once
- Remove bullets when they go off screen

## Key Concepts Review

**Event Loop Pattern:**
```
Check for input ‚Üí Update positions ‚Üí Check boundaries ‚Üí Draw everything ‚Üí Repeat
```

**Movement Pattern:**
```
Input changes velocity ‚Üí Velocity changes position ‚Üí Position determines where to draw
```

This pattern is used in almost every game, so understanding it now will help you forever!

**Great job!** You now have a controllable spaceship. The game is starting to feel interactive! üöÄ
